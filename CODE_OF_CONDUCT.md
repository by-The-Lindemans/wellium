# Code of Conduct

Our community stays welcoming and respectful so we can focus on empowering patients and care teams. All participants in wellium’s project agree to the following:

## Our Standards

- **Be respectful.** Critique code and ideas, never individuals.
- **Be inclusive.** Welcome diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.
- **Protect privacy.** Never post actual medical records, personal identifiers, or sensitive health details.
- **Contribute in good faith.** Ensure your own work is honest, transparent, and aligned with our shared values.
- **Engage with empathy.** When reviewing or discussing others’ contributions, assume positive intent; Hanlon’s Razor reminds us not to ascribe malice where misunderstanding suffices.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
- Sharing private or clinical data publicly
- Disparaging or ridiculing others’ contributions
- Circumventing our review or privacy processes

## Enforcement

If someone violates these guidelines, maintainers may warn, suspend, or ban that person. To report an incident, email **[hello@wellium.app](mailto:hello@wellium.app)** or open a confidential issue titled “Code of Conduct Incident.”

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
