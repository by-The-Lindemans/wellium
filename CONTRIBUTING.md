# Contributing to wellium

We build tools that keep health data in your hands and in sync with your care team. Every contribution helps us create a more trustworthy, user‑centered platform.

## Before you start

1. Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. Check for existing issues or discussions on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/by-The-Lindemans/wellium/issues).
3. Fork the repository and sync your fork with the `main` branch.
4. Install dependencies and run tests:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   ```

## Filing an issue

Use our Issue Forms (create a new issue and pick “Bug report” or “Feature request”). They guide you through:

- Describing the problem or idea
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs) or use cases (for features)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any relevant environment info (platform, version)

## Creating a pull request

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

1. Create a branch named with this pattern:
   - `feat/short-description` for new features
   - `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
2. Make your changes.
3. Write clear commit messages in imperative tense (e.g., “Add CSV import”).
4. Add or update tests and keep them passing (`npm test`).
5. Include the privacy checklist in your PR description.
6. Link the issue your PR addresses (e.g., “Fixes #123”).

## Review process

- We aim to review PRs within one week.
- Maintain respect and focus feedback on code, not people.
- After approval, a maintainer will merge your changes and you will be added to the contributors list.

Thank you for helping us build a health platform that puts patients first.
